                Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:
                1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
                 is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
                 in config/environments/development.rb:

                 In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.
                2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
                 For example:
